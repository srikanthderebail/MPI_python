# MPI_python
Simple functions written using mpi4py for learning.

This was written initially for myself to learn how to use MPI routines in python using mpi4y.
Eventually, a blog was written by me to help me remember well about all the different concepts in MPI, which can be found here:

a) hello.py: how to print 'hello world' using n processes.
b) sendrecv.py: blocking and non-blocking point to point communication
c) collective.py: Collective communications such as scatter,gather,broadcast, alltoall
d) reduce.py: Reduce operations in MPI
e) topompi.py: Creation of cartesian communicators and their sub-communicators
